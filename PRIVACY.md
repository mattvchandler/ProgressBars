# Privacy Policy

ProgressBars does not:

* record, collect, store any personal information
* transmit or receive any information

### Note on location permission

ProgressBars will ask for permission to access your device's locations if

* You are running a version of Android before Marshmallow
* OR you choose 'Auto (location / time based)' for the Day / Night theme setting

The location is used to determine local sunset sunrise times and switch to the
night theme after sunset.

The location is only used within the built-in Android theming library code. See
the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/AppCompatDelegate#mode_night_auto)
for details.

ProgressBars does not access, use, store, or transmit the location

Should you choose to deny the location permission, normal functionality will
continue, and the theming library falls back to switching on preset times.
